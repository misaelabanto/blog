	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<p>
		Hi! I'm <strong>Misael Abanto</strong>, a Peruvian software engineer specializing in fullstack development and data architecture. With over 8 years of experience, I've built scalable systems that have impacted thousands of users.
	</p>

	<h2>My Journey</h2>
	
	<p>
		My career began as a backend developer, but I quickly evolved into more strategic roles where I could combine my passion for technology with business impact. I have led development teams, designed complex data architectures, and built products from scratch to scale to millions of users.
	</p>

	<p>
		Currently, I work as a Senior Data Architect at a leading fintech company, where I design and implement data solutions that process thousands of daily transactions with strict security and compliance requirements.
	</p>

	<h2>Specialties</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Backend & APIs:</strong> Node.js, Python, Go, PostgreSQL, MongoDB</li>
		<li><strong>Frontend:</strong> TypeScript, Astro, Tailwind CSS, Flutter</li>
		<li><strong>Cloud & DevOps:</strong> AWS, Docker, Coolify, CI/CD</li>
		<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Technical team management, system architecture, mentoring</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
	
	<p>
		I am also a passionate entrepreneur. I have co-founded and technically led several startups, including a SaaS platform for medical appointment management that reached over 50,000 active users. This experience taught me the importance of quickly validating ideas, building efficient MVPs, and scaling products with limited resources.
	</p>

	<h2>Philosophy</h2>
	
	<p>
		I firmly believe in the power of technology to solve all kinds of problems, from the most mundane to the most unusual. I am passionate about building systems that not only work well technically but also change people's perception of software and technology in general.
	</p>

	<p>
		In my work, I prioritize:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The best solutions are often the simplest</li>
		<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Designing with the future in mind, but without over-engineering</li>
		<li><strong>Quality:</strong> Clean, well-tested, and documented code</li>
		<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Focus on metrics that matter to the business</li>
		<li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Technology is constantly evolving</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Outside of Code</h2>
	
	<p>
		When I'm not writing code, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about startups and technology, and sharing knowledge through mentoring and technical talks. I also like to travel, space, and read a lot.
	</p>

	<h2>Let's Connect</h2>
	
	<p>
		I am always open to interesting conversations about technology, startups, system architecture, or any challenging project. You can find me at:
