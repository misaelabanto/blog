Several weeks ago, I finished reading Charles Baudelaire's 'Les Fleurs du Mal' and was hesitant about publishing an opinion.

Let's see... Firstly, I don't believe it's suitable for anyone under sixteen. And if the age exceeds sixteen, I think they should have read at least one entire poetry collection. Many metaphors, let's remember that Baudelaire is the precursor of symbolism. Called the Cursed Poet. Why? I must say that the content of the poetry collection is strong; it can wound ethical and moral thoughts, as well as religious beliefs and concepts of beauty. It's a book for open-minded people, not those with closed ideas, rigid brains, and who are easily influenced. I almost don't recommend it, but if someone wishes to do so, let them.
