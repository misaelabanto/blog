A few days ago, I finished reading 2010: An Odyssey Two by Arthur C. Clarke. What can I say? Well; first of all, it's much better than the first book; much, much better, I think. Have you ever imagined what kind of life there could be on other worlds? Well, in this book, there are types of life that could only fit in Clarke's mind. This book can explain many things about space. And if you're a skeptic of ghosts, here they can scientifically explain how a ghost can exist. How strange! I think most people believe in ghosts as a matter of faith, not scientifically speaking; there are also those who believe in extraterrestrials and UFOs, but also as a form of faith; hence, the word "believe." Here, of course, they talk about intelligent extraterrestrial life, but in a scientific way. It's not very complex to read, although it should be read very carefully so as not to miss any detail. This wonderful book could only be written by someone as daring to imagine as Clarke. I loved it and will recommend it; but, as always, with great caution.
