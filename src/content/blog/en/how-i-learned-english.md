Well, I learned on Duolingo and I'm already at 1200 days, and it helped me a lot. That's how I got my first job in the USA. In this post, I will explain how I started and how I managed to maintain the streak for over three years. 

## The Beginnings

In school, learning English was very important to me, but my family didn't have enough money to enroll me in an academy. However, I did have internet, and with it, I could experiment with YouTube. In those days, there wasn't as much English content as there is now, but I still wasn't encouraged to consume that content. I thought I could learn by changing my environment to English. So I set some guidelines: 

- Having my phone's language set to English

- Facebook's language also in English

- Finally, watching movies with English subtitles

## The Evolution

With these guidelines, started at age 15, I learned many concepts, but all were limited to settings and applications, as I continued consuming content in Spanish. This meant my vocabulary didn't grow much. Nevertheless, I continued with this method until after entering university. In university, I tried many times to maintain a consistent Duolingo streak, but I often lost it. Still, I had an interesting foundation with which I could understand some intermediate texts and news.

## Duolingo

Everyone said English was important, and I knew it well, but I wasn't able to study anything. I felt like I wasn't making any progress at all and that I always had the same level as in school. One day, my professor Rony Hancco held a habits workshop based on Atomic Habits, and I discovered a simple but very effective method to never stop doing my lessons: **“make it visible.”** By simply replacing my most frequent applications with the Duolingo app, I managed to open it more often through “muscle memory.” It wasn't easy; I reached my first 170-day streak the first time and lost it. It hurt a lot; even so, I kept trying from scratch and reached 365 days. A full year of practice. And that's how I discovered that the problem was discipline, not just knowledge. 

## Work Environment

In 2021, I got a job at Devsu. During the interview, they asked me to answer a few questions in English. They asked me how I would build a giant, global-scale system—the question wasn't easy, and in English, even less so. I was very fortunate to learn that I was finally hired and sent to do some interviews with
