I learned using Duolingo and by changing my digital environment to English. In this post I describe how I started and how I kept practicing consistently over the years.

Beginnings: at school I wanted to learn English but we couldn't afford courses. With internet access, I used YouTube and set my phone and social media to English, and watched films with English subtitles.

Progress: these habits gave me a foundation, though my vocabulary grew slowly because I still consumed a lot of Spanish content. During university I tried and sometimes lost Duolingo streaks, but I kept building an intermediate level.

Duolingo and habits: after attending a habits workshop, I learned to 'make it visible' by placing the app where I would open it often. That helped me build long streaks and realize discipline matters as much as knowledge.

Work and real practice: in 2021 I got a job where I had to speak English. I struggled at first, so I increased exposure to real English content. In 2024 I applied to many companies and eventually landed a 100% remote job in the USA after several interviews in English.
