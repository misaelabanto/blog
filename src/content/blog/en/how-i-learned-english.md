Well, I learned on Duolingo and I'm already at 1200 days, and it helped me a lot. That's how I got my first job in the USA. In this post, I will explain how I started and how I managed to maintain the streak for over three years.

## The Beginnings

In school, learning English was very important to me, but my family didn't have enough money to enroll me in an academy. But I did have internet, and with it, I could experiment with YouTube. In those days, there wasn't as much English content as there is now, but I still wasn't encouraged to consume that content. I thought I could learn by changing my environment to English. So I set some guidelines for myself:

- Have my phone's language set to English

- Facebook's language also in English

- Finally, watch movies in English with subtitles

## The Evolution

With these guidelines started at age 15, I learned many concepts, but all were limited to configurations and applications, as I continued consuming content in Spanish, which prevented my vocabulary from growing much. Nevertheless, I continued with this method until after entering university. At university, I tried many times to maintain a consistent Duolingo streak, but I often lost it. Still, I had an interesting foundation with which I could understand some intermediate texts and news.

## Duolingo

Everyone said English was important, and I knew it well, but I wasn't able to study anything. I felt like I wasn't making any progress at all and that I always had the same level as in school. One day, my professor Rony Hancco held a habits workshop based on Atomic Habits, and I discovered a simple but very effective method to never stop doing my lessons: **"make it visible."** Just by replacing my applications
