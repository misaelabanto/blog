Well, I learned on Duolingo, and I'm already at 1200 days, and it helped me a lot. That's how I got my first job in the USA. In this post, I will explain how I started and how I managed to maintain the streak for over three years. 

## The beginnings

In school, learning English was very important to me, but my family didn't have enough money to enroll me in an academy. But I did have internet, and with it, I could experiment with YouTube. In those days, there wasn't as much English content as there is now, but I still wasn't encouraged to consume that content. I thought I could learn by changing my environment to English.
