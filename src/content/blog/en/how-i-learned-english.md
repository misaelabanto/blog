Well, I learned on Duolingo and I'm already on a 1200-day streak. That's how I got my first job in the USA. In this post, I will explain how I started and how I managed to maintain the streak for over three years. 

## The Beginnings

In school, learning English was very important to me, but my family didn't have enough money to enroll me in an academy. But I did have internet, and with it, I could experiment with YouTube. In those days, there wasn't as much English content as there is now, but I still wasn't encouraged to consume that content. I thought I could learn by changing my environment to English. So I set some guidelines for myself: 

- Have my phone's language set to English

- Facebook's language also in English

- Finally, watch movies in English with subtitles

## The Evolution

With these guidelines, started at age 15, I learned many concepts, but all were limited to settings and applications, as I continued consuming content in Spanish, which meant my vocabulary didn't grow much. Nevertheless, I continued with this method until after I entered university. At university, I tried many times to maintain a consistent Duolingo streak, but I frequently lost it. Still, I had an interesting foundation with which I could understand some intermediate texts and news.

## Duolingo

Everyone said English was important, and I knew it well, but I wasn't able to study anything. I felt like I wasn't making any progress at all and that I always had the same level as in school. One day, my professor Rony Hancco held a habit workshop based on Atomic Habits, and I discovered a simple but very effective method to never stop doing my lessons: **"make it visible."** Just by replacing my most frequent apps with the Duolingo app, I managed to open it more times through "muscle memory." It wasn't easy; I reached my first 170-day streak the first time and lost it. It hurt a lot; even so, I kept trying from scratch and reached 365 days. A full year of practicing. And that's how I discovered that the problem was discipline, not just knowledge. 

## Work Environment

In 2021, I got a job at Devsu. During the interview, they asked me to answer a few questions in English. They asked me how I would build a giant, global-scale systemâ€”the question wasn't easy, and in English, even less so. I was very fortunate to learn that I was finally hired, and they sent me to do some interviews with business clients to assign me to a project. It didn't go entirely well: in a real environment, I froze, didn't understand much of what they were saying, and felt too insecure about myself. 

## Takeoff

I changed my environment and content consumption again. I started watching series entirely in English with English subtitles, and I also started following more English content creators. Although it was difficult to understand at first, I didn't pay much attention to it and focused on continuing to create the content.
