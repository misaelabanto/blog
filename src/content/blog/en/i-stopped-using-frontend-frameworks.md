I finally stopped using frontend frameworks. I started in the web development world using Angular, then I liked Vue more, and at Devsu, I used React. Finally, now I don't use any. Why? In this article, I will explain in detail what led me to make this decision. ## State management Imagine you have a CRUD application. The process to carry it out with YouTube tutorials and for beginner developers, like I was at the beginning, would be the following: - Define database model - Choose a database engine - Choose a backend framework. It could be Express.js, Nest.js, or Hono - Implement a REST API in this backend - Choose a frontend framework. It could be Angular, Vue, or React. - Implement services that consume the REST API - Implement the UI Can you already see what the problem is here? ```mermaidgraph LR  DATABASE --> BACKEND  BACKEND --> ENDPOINT1  BACKEND --> ENDPOINT2  ENDPOINT1 --> UI_SERVICE1  UI_SERVICE1 --> UI_STATE1  UI_SERVICE1 --> UI_STATE2  UI_SERVICE1 --> UI_STATE3  ``` ## How a web application should look We all know that we should separate the presentation layer from the business layer. It's something we often forget. In a web application, HTML is just another presentation layer, made of text. ```mermaidgraph LR  DATABASE --> BUSINESS  BUSINESS --> UI_PRESENTATION_LAYER  BUSINESS --> API_PRESENTATION_LAYER   ``` Servers are good at serving and returning text, any type of text, not just JSON. 😉 ## HTMX In my latest projects, I have consistently used HTMX. This has allowed me to accelerate development since I no longer program two independent projects, one for frontend and one for backend, but only backend, showing how each part of the web should be updated. This has also allowed me to see things differently. Sometimes it is also much easier to create a custom HTML component instead of handling forms in strange ways, such as creating a long list of useState calls, as in the following example: ![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b9eb5589-c2ac-4c5c-8357-49b23d1b7529/04eb041f-b9a8-4557-a7a2-a22247bfdf36/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466RQZOFQMG%2F20251102%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251102T011726Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEG0aCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQDeBqUEX3EdZvF%2FUgjQtNP2%2B0AFGVPCOGGa1be3YZ6P1QIgWTVy2EmL4bB%2BzPjwFAkJ6zoiO%2FCPILuMBRiiZERQXuwq%2FwMINhAAGgw2Mzc0MjMxODM4MDUiDEGLNLlqOIgpOYX%2F%2FyrcA7V%2Bg0wklXq53S0dwY9R8mhLcaGYyfg8LB6b30tXqFdipivW%2BohlFkJ30FymSEv0bCpdI4G9b7Jd7XUXv7ov6xZGj6T1GfdPqwcJnWz1V9DSRIjurTNCIreKlnHiW3OoBmoG0vs7XIRTCud2RVKft3hahE3PkG6%2BZfSYHgSl1l2GDuLYr9Y8S1kxeRRAhbCFgUBzTF9Z0ZlWtC0xF2j8WWc1AE3Ci8EMj4aloW26ODsMMSEDPr7DnM%2FUSfmlbEXb9WBZ7NFKc4PkwCFY01A%2BVvor6lWhi579TCkJjb2EPPfooPtircQS9AU1Rbd4h36p0oAWR5FLqeycJUZDccHTaJEhTzyfVZVUqAuvpQyZI9Jkz3hkvsmS8yme8m8tyk0HULZx4%2FxvIYnLNejCI%2FE5ByMy6ExXEU3kfPdP0cDx9pZ%2FeVIMn6WpJ0ttk8oIP6KIveKYNQY9GdgwkRXUI3DHYnQzBwAgjBV%2Fop6XKXoc2UDJIkomMY3Eh11EVNud9eT6n7PfyD%2Fk2B540uRohxS1xRymbkCsfoLY3xOjSDvZET4iRdfL6Df6fH94pIm2MFX%2FfcRoXFAunQckbvlqC%2B0HA0%2FdWwlRcepjQderd92IcUZ9IRjUiKNHCzMEZUnjMPfZmcgGOqUBeE8fdszErA4WWIMdiziMDlKPN4yVniJtWqd8px%2F%2F1xML8yawWEn2kY23%2FeNM5EcG5HoRTLQ%2FqEujPWg6ZyUjkgpSWiLeyrhpT1lFtrWykMy3xGLAMs9UieFc80hZ9ldt8dlKqj9rJr2l6F7Z1H2t8dL04dAk8pYJYPWGWDdrXjQQQPkMKGJISvdi6sW1oGSG1VMXBsLJgq%2BcVIDBjunupdKrKxFu&X-Amz-Signature=128b076de5da9b2861af7a2816d684a7a3b307554193c4c81d9c198b7e9a6203&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject) On the internet, there are also other horrible examples, like this: ![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b9eb5589-c2ac-4c5c-8357-49b23d1b7529/ebb24493-fdad-41c1-a285-e2141b9987ec/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466RQZOFQMG%2F20251102%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251102T011726Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEG0aCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQDeBqUEX3EdZvF%2FUgjQtNP2%2B0AFGVPCOGGa1be3YZ6P1QIgWTVy2EmL4bB%2BzPjwFAkJ6zoiO%2FCPILuMBRiiZERQXuwq%2FwMINhAAGgw2Mzc0MjMxODM4MDUiDEGLNLlqOIgpOYX%2F%2FyrcA7V%2Bg0wklXq53S0dwY9R8mhLcaGYyfg8LB6b30tXqFdipivW%2BohlFkJ30FymSEv0bCpdI4G9b7Jd7XUXv7ov6xZGj6T1GfdPqwcJnWz1V9DSRIjurTNCIreKlnHiW3OoBmoG0vs7XIRTCud2RVKft3hahE3PkG6%2BZfSYHgSl1l2GDuLYr9Y8S1kxeRRAhbCFgUBzTF9Z0ZlWtC0xF2j8WWc1AE3Ci8EMj4aloW26ODsMMSEDPr7DnM%2FUSfmlbEXb9WBZ7NFKc4PkwCFY01A%2BVvor6lWhi579TCkJjb2EPPfooPtircQS9AU1Rbd4h36p0oAWR5FLqeycJUZDccHTaJEhTzyfVZVUqAuvpQyZI9Jkz3hkvsmS8yme8m8tyk0HULZx4%2FxvIYnLNejCI%2FE5ByMy6ExXEU3kfPdP0cDx9pZ%2FeVIMn6WpJ0ttk8oIP6KIveKYNQY9GdgwkRXUI3DHYnQzBwAgjBV%2Fop6XKXoc2UDJIkomMY3Eh11EVNud9eT6n7PfyD%2Fk2B540uRohxS1xRymbkCsfoLY3xOjSDvZET4iRdfL6Df6fH94pIm2MFX%2FfcRoXFAunQckbvlqC%2B0HA0%2FdWwlRcepjQderd92IcUZ9IRjUiKNHCzMEZUnjMPfZmcgGOqUBeE8fdszErA4WWIMdiziMDlKPN4yVniJtWqd8px%2F%2F1xML8yawWEn2kY23%2FeNM5EcG5HoRTLQ%2FqEujPWg6ZyUjkgpSWiLeyrhpT1lFtrWykMy3xGLAMs9UieFc80hZ9ldt8dlKqj9rJr2l6F7Z1H2t8dL04dAk8pYJYPWGWDdrXjQQQPkMKGJISvdi6sW1oGSG1VMXBsLJgq%2BcVIDBjunupdKrKxFu&X-Amz-Signature=ae3462e2e08fadf6de4bfc84b4bfebca6f0725e32c10bf1c5b9cbfd66042f1e1&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject) I wonder if it's necessary to have this whole mess of states. Why do we have to live like this? I feel that since I started using HTMX, my web apps have been significantly simplified and improved. Yes, I know. A project can be developed with much cleaner and more organized code than this, but unfortunately, that's not the most common. Anyway, I do enjoy writing code in Flutter, for which I cannot render directly from the server, right? I like the language (Dart); I think it's a modern and easy-to-use language. However, I've really liked GetX for state management because the abstraction is super intuitive. It's one of the best frameworks I've seen.
