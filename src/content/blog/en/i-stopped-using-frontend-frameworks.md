title: ""I stopped using frontend frameworks""
description: ""The author explains why they decided to stop using frontend frameworks, highlighting the common complexities of state management in typical web development. They advocate for a backend-centric approach using tools like HTMX, which they believe simplifies development by shifting UI updates to the server. While favoring this method for web applications, the author expresses appreciation for Flutter and its GetX state management for mobile development.""
