title: "I Stopped Using Frontend Frameworks"
description: "After years of using frameworks like Angular, Vue, and React, I've decided to abandon them due to the complexity they introduce, especially in state management. Currently, I use tools like HTMX to simplify development, allowing my backend to directly handle the presentation layer and returning to a more intuitive web model."

I finally stopped using frontend frameworks. I started in the web development world using Angular, then I liked Vue more, and at Devsu I used React. Finally, now I don't use any. Why? In this article, I will explain in detail what led me to make this decision. ## State management Imagine you have a CRUD application. The process to carry it out with YouTube tutorials and for beginner developers, as I was initially, would be the following: - Define database model - Choose a database engine - Choose a backend framework. It can be Express.js, Nest.js, or Hono - Implement a REST API in this backend - Choose a frontend framework. It can be Angular, Vue, or React. - Implement services that consume the REST API - Implement the UI Can you already see what the problem is here? ```mermaid graph LR DATABASE --> BACKEND BACKEND --> ENDPOINT1 BACKEND --> ENDPOINT2 ENDPOINT1 --> UI_SERVICE1 UI_SERVICE1 --> UI_STATE1 UI_SERVICE1 --> UI_STATE2 UI_SERVICE1 --> UI_STATE3 ``` ## How a web application should look We all know that we should separate the presentation layer from the business layer. It's something we often forget. In a web application, HTML is just another presentation layer, made of text. ```mermaid graph LR DATABASE --> BUSINESS BUSINESS --> UI_PRESENTATION_LAYER BUSINESS --> API_PRESENTATION_LAYER ``` Servers are good at serving and returning text, any kind of text, not just JSON. 😉 ## HTMX In my latest projects, I have used HTMX consistently. This has allowed me to accelerate development since I no longer program two independent projects, one for frontend and one for backend, but only backend, showing how each part of the web should be updated. This has also allowed me to see things differently. Sometimes it is also much easier to create a custom HTML component instead of handling forms in strange ways, such as creating a long list of useState, as in the following example: ![27f326c8-cefd-8062-a651-e7afa7ea6985.png](/blog/deje-de-usar-frontend-frameworks/27f326c8-cefd-8062-a651-e7afa7ea6985.png) On the internet, there are also other horrific examples, like this one: ![27f326c8-cefd-80b6-8a18-f6e43d9db04c.png](/blog/deje-de-usar-frontend-frameworks/27f326c8-cefd-80b6-8a18-f6e43d9db04c.png) I wonder if all this tangle of states is necessary. Why do we have to live like this? I feel that since I started using HTMX, my web apps have been significantly simplified and improved. Yes, I know. A project can be developed with much cleaner and tidier code than this, but unfortunately, that is not the most common. In any case, I do enjoy writing code in Flutter, for which I *cannot* render directly from the server, right? I like the language (Dart); I think it's a modern and easy-to-use language. I have also really liked GetX for state management because the abstraction is super intuitive. It's one of the best frameworks I've seen. In conclusion, I believe that frontend web development is returning to its beginnings in a simpler and more accessible way. It is likely that I will soon do a tutorial on how to make an E2E server using only Elysia or Hono and HTMX.
