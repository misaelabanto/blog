## Project Overview

Agéndalo.io is a smart appointment scheduling platform that I co-founded and built from the ground up. The platform serves small to medium businesses by providing them with a comprehensive solution for managing appointments, customer relationships, and business operations.

## Key Features

- **Smart Scheduling**: Intelligent appointment booking with conflict resolution
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: SMS, email, and push notifications for appointments
- **Payment Integration**: Seamless payment processing with Stripe
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive business insights and reporting
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive design optimized for mobile usage

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built using a modern tech stack with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. We implemented a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability as the platform grew.

### Backend Services
- **API Gateway**: Centralized request routing and authentication
- **Appointment Service**: Core scheduling logic and conflict resolution
- **Notification Service**: Multi-channel notification system
- **Payment Service**: Secure payment processing and billing
- **Analytics Service**: Data processing and reporting

### Database Design
We used PostgreSQL as our primary database with Redis for caching and session management. The database schema was designed to handle complex scheduling scenarios while maintaining performance.

## Business Impact

- **User Growth**: Scaled to 10,000+ active business users
- **Revenue**: Generated $500K+ in annual recurring revenue
- **Market Validation**: Successfully validated product-market fit in LATAM
- **Exit Process**: Currently in negotiations for acquisition

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Scalability
Implemented horizontal scaling strategies that allowed the platform to handle 100K+ appointments per month without performance degradation.

### Real-Time Updates
Built a real-time notification system using WebSockets that keeps all stakeholders updated on appointment changes instantly.

### Payment Complexity
Integrated with multiple payment providers across different countries, handling various currencies and local payment methods.
